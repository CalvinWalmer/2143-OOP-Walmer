## P04 - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS)
### Calvin Walmer
### Description:

This program is a console based simulation of RPSLS. The player cannot play the game because the game generates two players that play against each other. The output of the program contains emojis so output may not look correct on all systems. The program generates two players with random weapons and then pits them against each other. The program uses a lookup table to determine who won the round. If there is a tie, the weapons are regenerated until the two weapons are not the same.
